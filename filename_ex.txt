Sometimes we do not want to write whole files 
again from scratch, and instead 
wish to change one or two small details.
To do this we need 
to learn the steps for editing files.
So far we have worked with files by 
manually opening and closing them. 
This can allow for more failure points 
when working with files, especially when 
it involves a high number of operations.
