# 1. What will be the output of this code?

number1 = input("Enter whole number: ")
number2 = input("Enter decimal number: ")

integer_number = int(number1)
float_number = float(number2)
round_number = int(round(float_number))

print(number1)
print(number2)
print(round_number)


# Answer: 
# ask for whole number input
# ask for decimal number input
# print number1 (whole no) 
# print number2 (decimal no)
# take number2 and convert into float type 
# print round_number as a integer of ROUNDED number2 which has been converted into float beforehand

#Correct answer
