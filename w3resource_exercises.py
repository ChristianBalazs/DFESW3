# 1. Write a Python program to find those numbers which are divisible by 7 and multiple of 5, between 1500 and 2700 (both included)

#varNum = range(1500, 2700,)

# for num in range(1500, 2700,20):
#     print(num)

# Doesn't work 
# for num in range(1500, 2700,50):
#     while num % 7 == 0 and num % 5 == 0:
#         print(num)
